# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of tweets. It uses machine learning techniques to classify the sentiment of each tweet based on its content.

## Overview

The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project aims to analyze the sentiment expressed in tweets. It employs natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to classify the sentiment of each tweet as either positive, negative, or neutral. The project utilizes a labeled dataset of tweets for training and evaluation purposes.

## Features

- Preprocessing of raw tweets: The tweets are preprocessed to remove special characters, digits, and stopwords, and to perform lemmatization.
- Feature extraction: Textual features are extracted from the preprocessed tweets, such as word frequency, n-grams, or word embeddings.
- Model training: Various machine learning algorithms are employed to train a sentiment classification model using the labeled dataset.
- Sentiment prediction: The trained model is used to predict the sentiment of new, unseen tweets.
- Evaluation: The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the sentiment classification model are computed using evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix and classification report.
